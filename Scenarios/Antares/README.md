<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Inspired from the Solarwinds attack, this scenario emulates one of the most dangerous attacks possible. Supply chain attacks consist in compromising the root of a service chain, in order to affect all the dependant infrastructures and systems. </p>
<p>Typically, the hackers will target a company's supplier rather than the company itself, to go unoticed and have a larger scope of action. </p>
<p>In this scenario, we want to acces a machine from the Y company, through a program called Antares.exe. Through fishing, we managed to get access to a machine of a software engineer, who works on the antares source code. Maybe there is a way to find the program's source code, and access the update server, through which the target will  update its program to our malicious version.</p>

<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>Push a malicious update of the Antares program, in order to get access to the Y company's machine.</p>
