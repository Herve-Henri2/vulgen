# How to use the content of this folder

For now the only purpose of this folder is to perform some test on docker images and containers.

Currently you can generate and run a container that will execute a python script and allow you to work in a bash terminal.

### Steps to follow

(Assuming your working directory is the 'docker_testing' folder.)

> ubuntu-python/create_img.sh  -  This will create an Ubuntu xenial image with python installed on it.

> ./create_img.sh  -  This will create the image with the python script and run it.
