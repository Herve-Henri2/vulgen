1. Infiltrate the update server of enterprise X
2. Inject malicious code into the software (the malicious code is premade on the kali machine)

---------------------------------------------
1. Through fishing, you managed to install a RAT on a developper's desktop, from there you need to find the access credentials to the update server.
2. Within the update server, find where the distributed application is, modify it then compile it again.
3. Push an update, by modifing the necessary files.
4. Go back to your machine and read the info you got :-)
